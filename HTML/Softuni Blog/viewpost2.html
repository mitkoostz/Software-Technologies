						<h1><b>How much programmers earn ? </b></h1>
					</header>

					<p>
					<h4>
						About <b>$100,000</b> a year. That's th
						e answer if you have been programming for 4
						+ years and work in a major tech hub like the Ba
						y area or NYC. Of course your mileage WILL vary. Your
						salary is dependent on your skill level, your experience a
						nd your negotiating power.
					</h4>


					<ul>
						<li>Most programmers will make between <b>$40,000</b> and <b>$120,000.</b></li>
						<li>Junior prgrammers, or people starting out in smaller cities can expect to make around <b>$30,000-$50,000</b>.
						</li>
						<li>Most average programmers are bringing in around <b>$60,000-$85,000</b> a year.</li>
						<li>Senior programmers will typically reach <b>$100,000</b>.</li>
						<li>And highly valued senior programmers can easily make <b>$120,000-$150,000+</b>.</li>
					</ul>
					Some programmers are even granted stock options or stock units in the company they work for.
					The first engineering hire for a startup can ge
					t up to 5% of the company, and if the startup does well that can turn into <b>millions</b>.

					<br>
					<br>
					Programming can make you some solid dough, that is for sure. But not every programmer is making six
					figur
					es, and I don't personally know any programmers who have made millions. In small towns even good
					programme
					rs might not make six figures. The salaries can vary wildly depending on what city you are in. But I
					have work
					ed in Austin, TX, New York City and the Bay area, and I can tell you salaries in those three places
					are very sim
					ilar. And from what you can see on websites like Glassdoor, most mi
					d-level programmers are netting between <b>60k-100k</b>.


					<br>
					Story time. In high school I had a computer science teacher named Mr. Evans, and he would always te
					ll us stories about 'being in the industry'. Mr. Evans said that they will hire you for Fortran,
					keep you arou
					nd till you are 40, then fire you. He said Fortran was the greatest language invented and everything
					that came af
					ter it sucked. But when we'd get home from school we would play with C++ and Visual Basic, two of
					the most popular
					languages at that time. If Mr. Evans would have learned C++ or VB, he probably could have gotten a
					better job, but i
					nstead he was stuc
					k teaching high school kids. Poor Mr. Evans was definitely not making <b>100k</b>.
