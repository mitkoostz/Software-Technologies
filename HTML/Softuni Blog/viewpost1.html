						<h1>Top 10 Programming Languages in 2017</h1>
					</header>

					<p>
						<small>Programming is something vast and rather individual as each
						developer chooses tools that are most convenient for them. However,
						certain languages, platforms and frameworks have claimed themselves as one o
						f the easiest and most efficient to use. Thus we have collected for you top-10
						programming
							languages loved by developers nowadays. Which one is your favorite?</small>


						<br>
						<h1><b>1. C#</b></h1>
						C Sharp has seen an increase in popularity over the last year. I
						t is an object-oriented and multi-paradigm language that encompasses man
						y disciplines. C# was developed by Microsoft and is designated for the Common Language Infrastructure.
						Though it is not so widespread as Java or Python, C# has its fans who appreciate the
						lack of headers, macros and templates, presence of LINQ and anonymous types.
					<br>
					<br>
					<h1><b>2. Python</b></h1>
					Python is a dynamic and general-purpose language that emphasizes
					code readability and enables developers to use fewer lines of code (in co
					mparison with Java or C++). It supports multiple programming paradigms and has a large standard library.
					Developers love this language for clear syntax, good OOP support and great shortcuts.
					<br>
					<br>
					<h1><b>3. Java</b></h1>
					Java is one the leading choices among developers all over the world. This la
					nguage is object-oriented and class-based and follow
					s the “WORA” principle: write once, run anywhere.
					People love Java for its concurrency (comparing it to be better than Python,
					for example), great variety of libraries and steadily good performance. Community is huge as we
					ll, meaning Java fans can always get a lot of support.
					<br>
					<br>
					<h1><b>4. C++</b></h1>
					This language is compiled, imperative and program-oriented and allows low-level m
					emory manipulation. C++ influenced a number of o
					ther languages, such as C# or Java and is used for a variety of purposes.
					Its key features that make it stand out are strong, static type system (making it possible
					to catch more errors within a compile time), ability to use it in a few programming styles, good perf
					ormance and expressiveness.

					<br>
					<br>
					<h1><b>5. C</b></h1>
					C is a general-purpose imperative language that supports structured prog
					ramming, recursion and lexical variable scope. It is designed to encourage cross-pl
					atform programming and is available on many platforms.
					This language is valued for being clear, providing access to hardware and making it possible
					to create tiny binaries.

					<br>
					<br>
					<h1><b>6. R</b></h1>
					This is an open source language for statistical computing and it
					is very popular among data miners and statisticians. This language is a GNU package.
					The R pros include its package ecosystem and its vastness and all the charting benefits.

					<br>
					<br>
					<h1><b>7. JavaScript</b></h1>
					S is an object-based and dynamic language and is one o
					f the core technologies of WWW content production. Even though some peop
					le tend to think Java and JS are the same (or at least, very similar) languages, Ja
					vaScript was influenced mostly by Self and Scheme.
					JavaScript is seeing a rise in popularity and is included in hottest web development
					trends for the year 2017.

					<br>
					<br>
					<h1><b>8. PHP</b></h1>
					It’s a server-side and general-p
					urpose language designed for web development. PHP is considered rat
					her easy to learn and is often chosen by junior developers.
					As well developers love that it’s portable, has a lot of high-quality solutions fo
					r an array of web problems and has a lot of frameworks.

					<br>
					<br>
					<h1><b>9. GO</b></h1>
					Go was created at Google and is an open-source language. It’s c
					ompiled and has such features as garbage collection, memory safety and limited structural typing.
					It is really a good choice if you work with network applications and web se
					rvers. Go also consistently behaves across platforms, which is also a good feature.

					<br>
					<br>
					<h1><b>10. Swift</b></h1>
					Swift is a multi-paradigm language developed
					by Apple and is one of the top choices among iOS developers. It support
					s such concepts as late binding, extensible programming and dynamic dispatch.
					Even though Swift is a relatively new language, it also saw ri
					se in popularity in 2017 and overall looks quite promising.
